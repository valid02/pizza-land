# Pizza Land

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Overview

Pizza Land is a React-based web application that allows users to order pizzas online. Users can choose from a variety of pizzas, add them to a shopping cart, manage quantities, and view the total price of their order. This project is built using React and leverages Context API for state management.

## Features

- **Pizza Selection:** Browse a list of delicious pizzas with detailed descriptions and prices.
- **Shopping Cart:** Add pizzas to the cart, update quantities, or remove them entirely.
- **Real-time Updates:** The cart and total cost update dynamically as items are added or removed.
- **User Interface:** Simple and intuitive UI with a header, modal-based cart, and pizza list.

## Project Structure

- **`/src/components`**: Contains React components used throughout the app.
  - **`/Cart`**: Components for displaying and managing the shopping cart.
  - **`/Layout`**: Components for the header and layout.
  - **`/Meals`**: Components for displaying available pizzas and meal summary.
  - **`/UI`**: Reusable UI components such as modals and cards.

- **`/src/store`**: Contains context and reducer logic for managing the cart state.

- **`/src/assets`**: Stores static assets like images.

- **`/src/helpers`**: Contains utility functions used throughout the application.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
